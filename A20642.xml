            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ancient Expoſitors found occaſion to note out of theſe words, will be in that: but by the new diſcoueries of ſome humors of men, and rumors of men, we ſhall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſay ſomewhat of a ſecond part to. The parts are, firſt, the Literall, the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall ſenſe of the words; And then an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent, a collaterall, an occaſionall ſenſe of them. The <hi>explication</hi> of the wordes, and the <hi>Application, Quid tunc, Quid nunc,</hi> How the words were ſpoken then, How they may be applied now, will be our two parts.

                        <hi>Part</hi> 1.</note>And into thoſe I paſſe with this proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That in all which I ſhall ſay this day, beeing to ſpeake often of <hi>God,</hi> in that <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as he is <hi>Lord of Hostes,</hi> and fights his owne battailes, I am farre from giuing fire to them that deſire warre. <hi>Peace</hi> in this world, is a pretious <hi>Earneſt,</hi> and a faire and louely <hi>Type</hi> of the euerlaſting peace of the world to come: And warre in this world, is a ſhrewd and fearefull <hi>Embleme</hi> of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14582:8"/>
diſcord and tumult, and torment of the world to come: And therefore, our <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God,</hi> bleſſe vs with this externall, and this internall, and make that lead vs to an eternall peace. But I ſpeake of this ſubiect, eſpecially to eſtabliſh and ſettle them, that ſuſpect Gods power, or Gods purpoſe, to ſuccour thoſe, who in forraine parts, grone vnder heauie preſſures in matter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> or to reſtore thoſe, who in forraine parts, are deueſted of their lawfull poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and inheritance; and becauſe <hi>God</hi> hath not done theſe great workes yet, nor yet raiſed vp meanes, in apparance, and in their apprehenſion, likely to effect it, That therefore <hi>God</hi> likes not the cauſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they begin to bee ſhaked in their owne Religion at home, ſince they thinke that God neglects it abroad. But, beloued, ſince God made all this world of nothing, cannot hee recouer any one peece thereof, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore any one peece, with a little? In the Creation, his production of ſpecifique formes, and ſeuerall Creatures in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall dayes, was much, very much; but not very much, compared with that, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14582:9"/>
he had done immediatly before, when he made Heauen and Earth of nothing. For, for the particular Creatures, God had then <hi>Praeiacentem Materiam,</hi> he had ſtuffe before him; enough to cut out Creatures of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſiſe, his <hi>Elephants</hi> of the Earth, his <hi>Whales</hi> and <hi>Leuiathans</hi> in the Sea. In that matter there was <hi>Semen Creaturarum,</hi> The Seed of all Creatures in that ſtuffe. But for the ſtuffe it ſelfe, the Heauen and Earth, God had not <hi>Semen Coeli,</hi> any ſuch ſeed of Heauen as that he could ſay to it, doe thou hatch a Heauen; he had not any ſuch <hi>Semen terrae,</hi> as that hee could bid that grow vp into an Earth: There was nothing at all, and all, that is, was produced from that; and then who ſhall doubt of his proceeding, if by a little he will doe much? He ſuffered his greater works to be paraleld, or to be counterfeit by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs Magicians;</hi> but in his leaſt, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Lice, hee brought them to confeſſe <hi>Digitum Dei,</hi> the finger of God; and that was enough; The arme of God, the hand of God needs not; where he will worke, his finger is enough, It was not that imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that dreame of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14582:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>

That was no part of the reaſon in that caſe: but ſince man ordinarily eſteemes it ſo, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily admires great workes in little forme, why will he not be content to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie <hi>God</hi> that way, in a faithfull confidence, that hee can and will doe great workes by weake meanes. Should God haue ſtayd to leuie, and arme, and traine, and muſter, and preſent men enow to diſcomfit <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib?</hi> Hee tooke a neerer way; he ſlew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two hundreth thouſand of them, in one night by an <hi>Angell.</hi>

S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes a vſefull Hiſtoricall note, That that land to which <hi>God</hi> brought the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was their owne land before; they were the right heires to it, lineally deſcended from him, who was the firſt poſſeſſor of it, after the floud: but they were ſo long out of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, as that they were neuer able to ſet their title on foot; nay, they did ſcarce know their own title, and yet <hi>God</hi> repoſſeſſed them of it, reinueſted them in it. It is ſo for <hi>perſons,</hi> and <hi>times</hi> in his wayes in this world, Much with few, much though late, and it is ſo in his wayes to the next world too: for <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Elias</hi> knew of no more but himſelfe,

one another, in fundamentall things. <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> may ioyne and meet. <hi>In Diluculis</hi> and in <hi>Crepuſculis,</hi> The dawning of the day, in the Morning, and the ſhutting in of the day in the Euening, make day and night ſo much one, as ſometimes you cannot tell which to call them: but <hi>Lux &amp; tenebrae,</hi> light and darknes, <hi>Midnight</hi> and <hi>Noone</hi> neuer met, neuer ioynd. There are points, which paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and vehemence of diſputation, haue carried farther a ſunder then needed: and theſe indeed haue made the greateſt noyſe; becauſe vpon theſe, for the moſt part, depends the matter of profit: and <hi>Beati paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fici,</hi> bleſſed were that labour, and that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that could reconcile thoſe things; and of that there might bee hope, becauſe it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but the Perſons that fight, it is not the thing, the matters are not ſo different.

But a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will neuer make <hi>Contrarieties in fundamentall things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> neuer make foundations, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peredifications, the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and the Traditions of men, all one. Euery man is a little world, ſayes the <hi>Philoſopher;</hi> Euery man is a little <hi>Church</hi> too; and in euery man there are two ſides, two armies: the fleſh fights againſt the Spirit.

So euery man is alſo a Souldier in that great and generall warre, betweene <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Beliall,</hi> the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and the will of man.

where men differ from <hi>God.</hi> That warre <hi>God</hi> hath kindled, and that warre muſt bee maintain'd, and maintain'd by his way; and his way, and his <hi>Ordinance</hi> in this warre, is Preaching.</p>

                  <p>In this phraſe, as we told you before, out of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> the ſame thing is intended, as in that place of Saint <hi>Paul, Let all things bee done decently, and in Order.</hi> That the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Edition</hi> reades, <hi>Fiant honeste;</hi> and then ſayes Saint <hi>Ambroſe, Honeſte fit, quod cum pace fit, That is done honeſtly, and decently, which is done quietly, and peaceably.</hi> Not with a peace, and indifferencie to contrary Opinions in fundamentall Doctrines, not to ſhuffle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions together, and make it all one which you chuſe, but a peace with perſons, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from contumelies, and reuilings.

But yet a perfect hatred is that too, which may conſiſt with perfection, and Charitie is perfection: a perfect hatred is that which a perfect, that is, a charitable man may beare, which is ſtill to hate <hi>Errors,</hi> not <hi>Perſons.</hi> When their inſolencies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs to ſpeake of them, we ſhall doe no good therein, if therein we proceed not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and in order. <hi>Christ</hi> ſayes of his <hi>Church:</hi>

that was their order, that occaſioned his ioy.</hi> For when there is not an vniforme, a comely, an orderly preſenting of matters of faith, faith it ſelfe growes looſe, and loſes her eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and preaching in the <hi>Church</hi> comes to bee as pleading at the Barre, and not ſo well: there the Counſell ſpeakes not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but him that ſent him, here wee ſhall preach not him who ſent vs, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> but our ſelues. <hi>Study to be quiet, and to doe your owne buſines,</hi>

in our <hi>Clergie,</hi> and other graue and reuerend <hi>Prelates</hi> of this <hi>Church;</hi> they preſented it to him, and thereupon hee entred into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. But that <hi>Emperour</hi> did but declare things conſtituted by other Councells be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but yet the giuing the life of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe Conſtitutions in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was introductorie, and many of the things themſelues were ſo. Amongſt them, his 70. <hi>Capitularie</hi> is appliable to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe; there hee ſayes, <hi>Epiſcopi videant, That the Biſhops take care, that all Preachers preach to the people the Expoſition of the Lordes Prayer:</hi> and he enioynes them too, <hi>Ne quid nouum, ne quid non Canonicum, That no man preach any new opinion of his owne;</hi> nay, though it bee the opinion of other learned men in other places, yet if it be <hi>Non Canonicum,</hi> not declared in the <hi>vniuerſall Church,</hi> not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>that Church,</hi> in which he hath his ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he may not preach it to the people: And ſo he proceeds there to <hi>Catechiſtical Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is not new then, which the <hi>Kings of Iudah</hi> did, and which the <hi>Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> did. But it is new to vs, if the <hi>Kings</hi> of this kingdome haue not done it. Haue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14582:27"/>
they not done it? How little the <hi>Kings</hi> of this kingdome did in <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> cauſes then, when by their conniuence that power was deuold into a forraine Prelates hand, it is pitie to conſider, pitie to remember, pitie to bring into Contemplation; And yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euen then our Kings did exerciſe more of that power, then our aduerſaries who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, will confeſſe. But, ſince the true iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction was vindicated, and reapplyed to the Crowne, in what iuſt height <hi>Henrie the eight,</hi> and thoſe who gouerned his Sonnes minoritie, <hi>Edward the ſixt,</hi> exerciſed that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> cauſes, none, that knowes their Story, knowes not. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ordinarily, wee ſettle our ſelues beſt in the Actions, and Precedents of the late <hi>Queene</hi> of bleſſed and euerlaſting memory, I may haue leaue to remember them that know, and to tell them that know not, one act of her power and her wiſedome, to this purpoſe. When ſome <hi>Articles</hi> concerning the falling away from iuſtifying grace, and other poynts that beat vpon that haunt, had been ventilated, in Conuenticle, and in Pulpits too, and Preaching on both ſides
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14582:28"/>
paſt, and that ſome perſons of great place and eſtimation in our <hi>Church,</hi> together with him who was the greateſt of all, amongſt our Clergy, had vpon mature deliberation eſtabliſhed a reſolution what ſhould bee thought, and taught, held and preached in thoſe poynts, and had thereupon ſent down that reſolution to be publiſhed in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, not vulgarly neither, to the people, but in a Sermon, <hi>Ad Clerum</hi> onely, yet her <hi>Maieſtie</hi> being informed thereof, declared her diſpleaſure ſo, as that, ſcarce any houres before the Sermon was to haue been, there was a Countermaund, an Inhibition to the Preacher for medling with any of thoſe poynts. Not that her <hi>Maieſtie</hi> made her ſelfe <hi>Iudge of the Doctrines,</hi> but that nothing, not formerly declared to be ſo, ought to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the <hi>Tenet,</hi> and Doctrine of this Church, her <hi>Maieſtie</hi> not being acquainted, nor ſuplicated to giue her gracious allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the publication thereof.</p>
                  <p>His ſacred <hi>Maiestie</hi> then, is herein vpon the ſteps of the <hi>Kings of Iudah,</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors,</hi> of the <hi>Kings of England,</hi> of all the <hi>Kings of England,</hi> that embraced the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14582:28"/>
Reformation, of <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> her ſelfe; and he is vpon <hi>his owne</hi> ſteps too. For, it is a ſeditious calumny to apply this which is done now, to any occaſion that riſes but now: as though the <hi>King</hi> had done this, now, for ſatisfaction of any perſons at this time. For ſome yeares ſince, when he was pleaſed to call the <hi>Heads of Houſes</hi> from the Vniuerſity, and intimate to them the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences that aroſe from the Preaching of ſuch men, as were not at all conuerſant in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the <hi>Schoole,</hi> nor in the <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Storie,</hi> but had ſhut vp themſelues in a few later <hi>Writers;</hi> and gaue order to thoſe <hi>Gouernours</hi> for remedy herein, Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, then he laid the foundation for that, in which hee hath proceeded thus much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now, to reduce Preaching neerer to the manner of thoſe Primitiue times, when <hi>God</hi> gaue ſo euident, and ſo remarkable bleſsings to mens Preaching.</p>
                  <p>Conſider more particularly that which he hath done now; His <hi>Maieſtie</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his moſt gracious Letter to the <hi>moſt Reuerend Father in God, my Lords Grace of Canterbury,</hi> with certaine <hi>Directions</hi> how
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14582:29"/>
Preachers ought to behaue themſelues in the exerciſe of <hi>that part</hi> of their Miniſterie. Theſe being deriued from his <hi>Grace,</hi> in due courſe to his <hi>reuerend Brethren,</hi> the other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> our <hi>worthy Dioceſan,</hi> euer vigilant for the Peace and vnitie of the <hi>Church,</hi> gaue a ſpeedy, very ſpeedy intimation thereof, to the <hi>Clergie</hi> of his Iuriſdiction; ſo did others, to whom it appertain'd ſo to doe in theirs. Since that, his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> who alwayes taking good workes in hand, loues to perfect his owne works, hath vouchſafed to giue ſome <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this his proceeding; which being ſignified by him to whom the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> owes much, <hi>The right Reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God, the Biſhop of Lincolne, Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the great Seale,</hi> and after by him alſo, who began at firſt, his <hi>Maieſties</hi> pleaſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing thereby, (as he is too <hi>Great,</hi> and too <hi>Good</hi> a <hi>King</hi> to ſeeke corners, or diſguiſes, for his actions) that theſe proceedings ſhould be made publique, I was not willing only, but glad to haue my part therein, that as, in the feare of God, I haue alwaies preached to you the <hi>Gospell of Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> who is the <hi>God</hi> of your Saluation; So in the teſtimony
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14582:29"/>
of a good Conſcience, I might now preach to you, <hi>the Goſpel of the Holy ghoſt,</hi> who is the <hi>God of peace,</hi> of vnitie, and concord.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Directions</hi> then, and the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of them, by his <hi>Maieſties</hi> particular care, euery man in the Miniſtery may ſee &amp; write out, in the ſeuerall <hi>Registers Offices,</hi> with his owne hand for nothing, and for very little, if hee vſe the hand of another. Perchance you haue, at your conuenience, you may ſee them. When you do, you ſhall ſee, That his <hi>Maieſties</hi> generall intention therein is, to put a difference, between graue, and ſolid, from light and humerous preaching. <hi>Origen</hi> does ſo, when vpon the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>There is a great difference, Inter praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, &amp; docere:</hi> A man may teach an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that is, make them know ſomething that they knew not before, and yet not Preach; for Preaching is to make them know things appertaining to their ſaluation. But when men doe neither, neither Teach, nor Preach, but (as his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> obſerues the manner to bee) <hi>To ſoare in poynts too deepe, To muſter vp their owne Reading, To diſplay their owne Wit, or Ignorance in medling with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

matters,</hi> or (as his <hi>Maiestie</hi> addes) <hi>in rude and vndecent reuiling of perſons:</hi> this is that which hath drawen downe his <hi>Maieſties</hi> piercing Eye to ſee it, and his Royall care to correct it.

all that Doctrine, which wrought this great cure vpon vs, in the Reformation, is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the two <hi>Catechiſmes,</hi> in the 39. <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and in the 2. <hi>Bookes of Homilies.</hi> And to theſe, as to <hi>Heads,</hi> and <hi>Abundaries,</hi> from whence all knowledge neceſſarie to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may abundantly be deriu'd, hee directs the meditations of Preachers.</p>

truly there was much reaſon) the capacitie, the memory, eſpecially of the child.

                  <p>The <hi>Primitiue Church</hi> diſcerned this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie of <hi>Catechiſing:</hi> And therefore they inſtituted a particular <hi>Office,</hi> a <hi>Calling</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Catechiſers.</hi> Which Office, as wee ſee in Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> 4.2. <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that great man <hi>Optatus</hi> exerciſed at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> When S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tooke the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalme</hi> of the day, for his Text to one Sermon, did he, thinke you, much more then paraphraſe, then Catechiſe?

                  <p>His <hi>Maieſtie</hi> therefore, who as he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands his duty to <hi>God,</hi> ſo doth he his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects duties to him, might iuſtly thinke, <hi>That theſe ſo well grounded Directions, might,</hi> (as himſelfe ſayes) <hi>bee receiu'd vpon implicite obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Yet hee vouchſafes to communicate to all, who deſire ſatisfaction, the <hi>Reaſons</hi> that mou'd him.

Of all which the Summ is, His <hi>Royall</hi> and his <hi>Paſtorall</hi> care, that <hi>by that Primitiue way of Preaching, his Subiects might be arm'd againſt all kind of Aduerſaries, in fundamentall truthes.</hi> And when he takes knowledge, <hi>That ſome few Church-men, but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14582:36"/>
many of the people, haue made ſiniſter conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his ſincere intentions, As hee is grieued at the heart,</hi> (to giue you his owne wordes) <hi>to ſee euery day ſo many defections from our religion to Popery and Anabaptiſme;</hi> So without doubt he is grieued with much bitternes, that any ſhould ſo peruert his meaning, as to thinke, that theſe <hi>Directions</hi> either <hi>reſtraind the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Preaching, or abated the number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or made a breach to Ignorance and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,</hi> of which three ſcandals he hath been pleaſed to take knowledge. What could any <hi>Calumniator,</hi> any <hi>Libeller</hi> on the other ſide, haue imagin'd more oppoſit, more contrary to him, then approaches towards <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Superſtition?</hi> Let vs ſay for him, Can ſo learned, ſo abundantly learned a <hi>prince</hi> be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to plot for <hi>Ignorance?</hi> And let vs bleſſe <hi>God,</hi> that we heare him ſay now, <hi>That he doth conſtantly profeſſe himſelfe an open aduerſary to the Superſtition of the Papiſt</hi> (without any milder Modification) and <hi>to the madneſſe of the Anabaptiſt:</hi> And that <hi>the preaching againſt either of their Doctrines is not only approued, but much commended by his royall Maieſtie, if it bee done without rude and vndecent reuiling.</hi> If hee
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14582:36"/>
had affected <hi>Ignorance</hi> in himſelfe, he would neuer haue read ſo much; and if he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>Ignorance</hi> in vs, hee would neuer haue writ ſo much, and made vs ſo much the more learned by his Books. And if hee had had any declination towards <hi>Superſtition,</hi> he would not haue gone ſo much farther, then his rank and qualitie preſſed him to doe, in declaring his opinion concerning <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as out of <hi>Zeale,</hi> and <hi>zeale with knowledge</hi> hee hath done. We haue him now, (and long, long, O eternall <hi>God,</hi> continue him to vs,) we haue him now for a <hi>father</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>Foſter-father;</hi> ſuch a father as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was; our poſterity ſhall haue him for a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Claſsique father;</hi> ſuch a father as <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> was.

Thus far he is from admitting <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and from <hi>Superstition</hi> thus far, which ſeemes to be one
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14582:37"/>
of their feares. And for the other two, (which concurre in one) <hi>That theſe Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould reſtraine the Exerciſe of Preaching, or abate the number of Sermons,</hi> his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> hath declar'd himſelfe to thoſe <hi>Reuerend Fathers, To be ſo far from giuing the leaſt diſcouragement to ſolid Preaching, or to diſcreet and religious Preachers, or from abating the number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that hee expects at their hands, that this ſhould increaſe their number, by renuing vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Sunday in the afternoon, in all Pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches throughout the kingdome, that primitiue, and moſt profitable expoſition of the Catechiſme.</hi> So that heere is no abating of Sermons, but a direction of the Preacher to preach vſefully, and to edification.</p>

                  <p>The firſt word of the Text is the

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14582:45"/>
their papers: ſo vnderminable is the loue of this World, which determines euery minute. <hi>GOD,</hi> as hee is three perſons, hath three Kingdomes; There is <hi>Regnum potentiae,</hi> The Kingdome of power; and this wee attribute to the <hi>Father;</hi> it is power and prouidence: There is <hi>Regnum gloriae,</hi> the Kingdome of glorie; this we attribute to the <hi>Sonn</hi> and to his purchaſe; for he is <hi>the King</hi> that ſhall ſay,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.34.</note> 
                        <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you, from the foundation of the World.</hi> And then betweene theſe three is <hi>Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Gratiae,</hi> The Kingdome of Grace, and this we attribute to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> he takes them, whom the king of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Almighty <hi>God</hi> hath reſcued from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 4.11.</note> and as the king of grace, <hi>Hee giues them the knowledge of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Kingdome of</hi> GOD, that is, of <hi>future glory,</hi> by ſanctifying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his grace, in his <hi>Church.</hi> The two firſt kingdomes are in this world, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14582:45"/>
yet neither of them, are of this world; becauſe both they referre to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory. The kingdome of the <hi>Father,</hi> which is the prouidence of <hi>God,</hi> does but preſerue vs; The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> which is the grace of <hi>God,</hi> does but prepare vs to the kingdome of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> which is the glory of <hi>GOD;</hi> and thats in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And therfore, though to good men, this world be the way to that kingdome, yet this kingdome is not of this world, ſayes Chiſt himſelfe: Though the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelues,<note place="margin">Iohn 18.36.</note> as good a <hi>Schoole</hi> as they were bred in, could neuer take out that leſſon yet that leſſon <hi>Chriſt</hi> giues, and repeates to all, you ſeeke a Temporall kingdome, <hi>But,</hi> ſayes the Text, ſtop there, A king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome you muſt not haue.</p>
                     <p>Beloued in him, whoſe kingdome, and Goſpell you ſeeke to aduance, in this Plantation, our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Sauiour Christ Ieſus,</hi> if you ſeeke to eſtabliſh a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14582:46"/>
temporall kingdome there, you are not rectified, if you ſeeke to bee <hi>kings</hi> in either acceptation of the word; To be a <hi>King</hi> ſignifies <hi>Libertie</hi> and <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pency,</hi> and <hi>Supremacie,</hi> to bee vnder no man, and to be a <hi>King</hi> ſignifies <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> and <hi>Omniſufficiencie,</hi> to neede no man. If thoſe that gouerne there, would eſtabliſh ſuch a gouernment, as ſhould not depend vpon this, or if thoſe that goe thither, propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues an exemption from Lawes, to liue at their libertie, this is to be <hi>Kings,</hi> to deueſt <hi>Allegeance,</hi> to bee vnder no man: and if thoſe that aduenture thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, propoſe to themſelues preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and profit, a ſodaine way to bee rich, and an aboundance of all deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble commodities from thence, this is to be ſufficient of themſelues, and to neede no man: and to bee vnder no man and to neede no man, are the two acceptations of being <hi>Kings.</hi> Whom li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty drawes to goe, or preſent profit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14582:46"/>
drawes to aduenture, are not yet in the right way. O, if you could once bring a <hi>Catechiſme</hi> to bee as good ware a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them as a Bugle, as a knife, as a hatchet: O, if you would bee as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hearken at the returne of a <hi>ſhip,</hi> how many <hi>Indians</hi> were conuerted to <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> as what trees, or druggs, or Dyes that Ship had brought, then you were in your right way, and not till then; <hi>Libertie</hi> and <hi>Abundance,</hi> are Characters of kingdomes, and a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is excluded in the <hi>Text;</hi> The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> were not to looke for it, in their employment, nor you in this your Plantation.</p>
                     <p>At leaſt CHRIST expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus farre, in this anſwer, that if he would giue them a kingdome,<note place="margin">Non adhuc.</note> hee would not giue it them yet. They aske him, <hi>Wilt thou at this time, reſtore the kingdome?</hi> and hee anſwers, <hi>It is not for you to know the times:</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <hi>God</hi> will doe, Man muſt not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14582:47"/>
appoint him his time. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> thought of a <hi>kingdome</hi> preſently after <hi>Chriſts</hi> departure; the comming of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who lead them into all truthes, ſoone deliuered them of that error. Other men in fauour of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> interpreting all the propheſies, which are of a <hi>Spirituall Kingdome,</hi> the kingdome of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> into which, the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall be admitted) in a literall ſenſe, haue thought that the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall haue, not onely a temporall kingdome in the ſame place, in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> againe, but becauſe they finde that kingdome which is promiſed, (that is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Goſpell</hi>) to bee expreſſed in large phraſes, and in an abundant manner, applying all that largeneſſe to a temporall kingdome, they thinke, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall haue ſuch a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as ſhall ſwallow and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all other kingdomes, and bee the ſole <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the world. After this, very great men in the <hi>Church</hi>

was excellently ſayde of <hi>Heretiques,</hi> (though by one, who, though not then declared,<note place="margin">Neſtorius.</note> was then an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi> in his heart,) <hi>Condolere Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis crimen est;</hi> It is a fault, not onely to bee too indulgent to an <hi>Heretique,</hi> but to bee too compaſsionate of an <hi>Heretique,</hi> too ſorrie for an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.</hi> It is a fault to ſay, Alas, let him alone, hee is but an <hi>Heretique;</hi> but, to ſay, Alas, hope well of him, till you bee better ſure, that hee is an Heretique, is charitably ſpoken. <hi>God</hi> knowes, the ſharpe and ſowre Name of <hi>Heretique,</hi> was too ſoone let looſe, and too faſt ſpread in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of the world.

Expoſition. And then, when once that infamous Name of <hi>Heretique</hi> was faſtened vpon a man, nothing was too heauie for, any thing was beleeued of that man. And from thence it is, without queſtion, that wee finde ſo many ſo abſurd, ſo ſenſeleſſe Opinions imputed to thoſe men, who were then called <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi> as could not, in trueth, with any poſsibilitie, fall into the imagi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation or fancie of any man, much leſſe bee <hi>Doctrinally,</hi> or <hi>Dogmatically</hi> deliuered.
